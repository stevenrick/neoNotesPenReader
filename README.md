# neoNotesPenReader

WIP script for deconstructing NeoNotes N2 data captured from smart pen and sent to mobile device app.

Current script expects user to specify the location of the page_store directory (which contains the raw data file "page.data").
This can be obtained by linking the NewNotes mobile app to Google Drive and downloading the sessions created by the device.

More refinement to come soon include writing to standard output formats (csv, xml, json)
